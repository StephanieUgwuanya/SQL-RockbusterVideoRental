<h1>SQL-RockbusterVideoRental</h1>

Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. 
Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the 
Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an 
online video rental service in order to stay competitive.


<h1>Key Questions & Objectives</h1>

Below are the questions addressed in my analysis to support Rockbuster Stealth LLC's transition to an online service:

<b>• Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain? </b>

<b>• What was the average rental duration for all videos? </b>

<b>• Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in? </b>

<b>• Where are customers with a high lifetime value based? </b>

<b>• Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?</b>


<h1>Data & Tools</h1>

Rockbuster relational database management system and Postgre SQL was used for the analysis purpose. The data set includes information about Rockbuster’s film inventory, customers, payments, stores, staff, films, actors, rental history and addresses.
Tableau was used to created the visualisations: <a href="https://public.tableau.com/shared/GWP3NZXSG?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link">Google</a>
